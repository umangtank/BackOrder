# Backorder-prediction

<p>
Backorder is an order which can’t be fulfilled at the given time due to lack of supply or the product is currently out of stock or not in inventory but can guarantee delivery of the goods or service requested by a certain date in the future because the production of goods or replenishment of inventory is underway. Unlike in the situation of Out-of-stock where the delivery date of the goods can’t be promised , in the Backorder scenario the customers are allowed to shop for the products and order. Simply put Backorder can be thought of as an order with a delayed delivery date.

Backorders are unavoidable, but by anticipating which things will be backordered, planning can be streamlined at several levels, preventing unexpected strain on production, logistics, and transportation. ERP systems generate a lot of data (mainly structured) and also contain a lot of historical data; if this data can be properly utilized, a predictive model to forecast backorders and plan accordingly can be constructed. Based on past data from inventories, supply chain, and sales, classify the products as going into backorder (Yes or No).
